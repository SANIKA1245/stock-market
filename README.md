Stock Market Financial Dashboard
This is a Project that I created in my free time. I made a simple financial dashboard using Python and the Bokeh Python library. The dashboard can display the stock prices of a company over time using Yahoo Finance Python Package, and the user can also add Indicators to help them make better investment decisions. The indicators include 100 Day SMA, 30 Day SMA, Linear Regression Line, 50 Day EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands.

Real-Time Stock Data: Fetch and display the latest stock prices and market data for various stocks.

Historical Data Visualization: View historical stock prices with interactive charts to analyze trends over time.

Stock Comparison: Compare multiple stocks side-by-side to evaluate performance metrics.

Technical Indicators: Calculate and visualize common technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) to assist in trading decisions.
